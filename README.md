## CAUTION: 
As in the original project some files have been added to .gitignore file, please read below:


You will need to create two .env files for your project: 
```
.env.test
```
and
```
.env.development
```

Into each, add 
```
PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>
```
Add the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names).
